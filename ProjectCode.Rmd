# Implementing Solutions to Label Switching for Bootstrap of EM Estimates

## Project Outline

-   Code, in Rcpp, the proposed stratified bootstrap method
-   Code, in Rcpp, the proposed separated bootstrap method
-   Code, in Rcpp, the proposed label switching adjustment, and then perform parametric bootstrap.
-   Code, in Rcpp, regular parametric bootstrap method
-   Obtain EM algorithm estimates for simulated data from a chosen mixture mode
-   Compare results through tables and graphs
-   Summarize where certain methods fail, succeed, and possible use cases for each
